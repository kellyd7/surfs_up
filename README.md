## Summary

Looking at the results of the two deliverables, I think it is safe to say that the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year round. Two additional queries that we could perform to gather more weather data for June and December would be:

1. A query on the percipitation data for December and June.
2. A query on the tourist activity during December and June.
